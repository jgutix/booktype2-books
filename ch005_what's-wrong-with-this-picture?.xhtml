    <h1>what's wrong with this picture?</h1><p style=""><br></p><p style="">hi adam. &nbsp;bowerbird intelligentleman here. &nbsp;and hey, i don't want anybody else "editing" or "collaborating" on this page either. &nbsp;got it? &nbsp;go make your own page, like i did. &nbsp;this one is just for adam and me.</p><p style="">adam, you're one of the very few guys doing e-book work today who i find even remotely interesting. &nbsp;you're doing some smart stuff, writing some interesting things. &nbsp;everybody else is just giving boring rehashes, or mushy observations. but you're sharp. &nbsp;there is, however, a fair amount of stupid mixed in to your thoughts as well. &nbsp;that's not surprising, of course. nobody gets everything right. &nbsp;everybody, including me, is a mix of smart and stupid, to varying degrees. &nbsp;but i'd certainly like to talk with you. &nbsp;however, i hate the o'reilly blog. &nbsp;(talk about stupid, and boring, and mushy. that place takes the cake. and they're running expensive conferences. that takes balls.)</p><p style="">so maybe you and i can talk on this page?</p><p style="">if not, adam, you can just delete this page.</p><p style="">thank you.</p><p style="">-bowerbird</p><p style=""><br></p><p style="">------------------</p><p style=""><br></p><p style="">im here :) cant promise to be stupid tho...will try.
