    <h1>Who makes a good facilitator?</h1><p>When I first started facilitating Book Sprints I did it because no one else would. I thought this kind of thing, what it was I wasn't sure, would be best left in the hands of people who make books. So I looked to the publishing industry and to the writing industries for help. I thought that these people would hold the keys to successful sprints. They knew what the mechanics of book production was. They knew what made a good book,who made a good book, and how to make a good book. I, on the other hand, had no idea. I was most recently a community activist of sorts. I was trying to motivate communities to write books. That involved motivating people, selling the idea, getting people involved. However once they were involved what they did was largely up to them.&nbsp;</p><p>So in the first Book Sprints I did everything I could to get the experts to take the lead. I just did the set up.</p><p>However, for one reason or another I found myself somehow trying to make sense of the process and trying to push it forward. What I noticed quite early on was that the experts, all brilliant people, didn't seem to be seeing the process the same as I was. Their blog posts and comments didn't seem to reflect what I had experienced.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
