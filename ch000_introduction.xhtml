    <h1 style="">Introduction</h1><p style="">This is a book about Book Sprints. It will give you an understanding of what Book Sprints are, the background, the philosophy embedded in the process and some straight out mechanics to help you do your own Book Sprints. </p><p style="">The book is aimed primarily at those wanting to facilitate Book Sprints. While the pages here will give you an idea on how to facilitate, and help you on your way, it will not make you a good facilitator. The only thing that can do that is experience and perhaps strange and undocumented nuances of your personality.&nbsp;</p><p style="">Facilitation is a murky art. Part mechanics, part intuition, part experience, part gutsy on the fly innovation. Facilitation calls on you to get outside of yourself and become part of the flow and dynamic of the people and ideas around you. You need to be able to shape that flow and point all its energy in the right direction. That means stepping out of the way as much as it means manipulating dynamics. When you are good at it and in that flow it comes without thinking and it all feels both natural and very weird.</p><p style="">You also need to be apart of things as well as a part from things. You need to be able to step up and break processes that are not working. Override the decisions of others and straight talk your way through difficult power dynamics and difficult people. You need to be able to do it without fear of being strongly disliked by the target of your correcting attention.</p><p style="">Being a good facilitator means you will often feel scared, out of your depth, and weird. You will also often feel bored, confronted, tired, angry, a desperate failure, and out of place. That's all normal. If you don't feel those things you are probably doing a bad job.</p><p style=""> If you can deal with all that you are possibly a good first candidate for reading this book and giving it a go.</p>
